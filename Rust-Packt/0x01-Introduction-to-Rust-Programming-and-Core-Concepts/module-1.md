## Introduction to Rust

* System language like c or c++ but have safety features like high level langusgaes
* Wonderful for programs needing speed with emphasis on safety and performamce

## Installation
* Rust can be installed on windows from the official site. Instructiosn for installing on linux systems are also available there.
* We can write rust in different ways either from the command line or using IDEs and text editors like VIM, VsCode, Atom, etc

## Compilation and running
* Rust programs are compiled with the `rustc` command which then compiles the program to an executable.
* For more complex programs and systems, **cargo** is used. Cargo is the default package manager and then can be used to track dependencies and install library.
```sh
cargo new // creates a new file
cargo install <library> // installs a new library etc
```
