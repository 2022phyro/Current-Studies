# AI AND THE FUTURE

## Bias in AIs

* Refers to the systematic errors or prejudices that can lead to unfair, discriminatory or inaccurate outcomes.
* Comes from our flaws as a civilization
* Stems from application of AI algorithms and training data without considering ethics

### Sources of Bias in AIs
* training data
* Algorithmic bias


### Societal impact
* Unfair treatment
* Discrimination
* Perpetuation of (harmful) stereotypes


### Mitigating bias in AI

* Diverse and Representative data
* Algorithmic fairness
* Transparency and accountability
* Ethical AI frameworks

## AI and the Environment

* AI is capable of analyzing the vast data gathereed from weather network, manage pipelines and projects, and monitor changes. Despite all these, the cost of training an maintaing an AI system itself is a huge and expensive cost for the environment. It is advised to move to more efficient systems in order to reduce the carbon footprint of the AI themselves


### Using AI responsibly

Personalized education: It can be used to provide a learning roadmap that makes learning easier and at one's own pace

### Misinformation of AI

AI is recently been used to spread misinformation, from AI bias to flawed data and algorithms, to misusage of AI via doctored videos, and text. There is now the rise of deepfakes making it difficult to tell the differences between the real and the doctored videos.

## AI Assistants

* Virtual helpers that enhance productivity and provide valuable support.
* They streamline personal and professional tasks, understand and respond to our inputs, making task completion easy and efficient

### Key Features of AI Assistants

* Natural Language Understanding
* Context Awareness
* Task Automation
* Learning and Adaptation

### Why use AI Assistants?

* Boosting productivity
* Connecting different parts of our life
* Enhancing learning and development


### Optimizing Workflow Efficiency

Streamlining one's workflow allows us to manage our time better, reduce stress and focus on what matters. This means organizing tasks efficiently, using tools that help us stay on track and cutting out unnecesssary steps

### → → The PARA Method
* PARA stands for *P*rojects, *A*reas, *R*esources, *A*rchives
  * *Projects:* Stands for the short term goals. They should have a specific goal and deadline
  * *Areas:* Ongoing responsibilities. They don't have a specific deadline. Eg includes "health"
  * *Resources:* Materials, references or information that you might find useful now or in the future
  * *Archives:* Where you store items that are no longer active but you might need to refer back to them in the future.


## AI-Powered Decision-Making

* Data are collected observations or measurements represented as text, numbers or multimedia
* Statistics is the result of data analysis or interpretation.
* AI can be used to help make informed decisions by analyzing the data at hand through the following steps

  * Understand the problem, set clear goals and identify what you want to solve
  * Data collection and preparation - gather and clean & preprocess the data
  * Exploratory data analysis - Summarize and visualize the data
  * Pattern recognition - Identify patterns and trends , and predictive analysis
  * Interpretation and decision making - interpret the results and use the interpretations to make informed decisions.
* The quality of data used *MATTERS* and can adversely affect the effectivenss of of the AI. Ensure the dat ais well structured and cleaned for optimal results

### From Data to Decisions

*Predictive Modelling:*
This involves use of stastical techniques and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to forecast future trends based on historical data. The basic steps of predictive modelling include
* Data preparation
* Model selection
* Training the model
* Validation and testing
* Forecasting

### Scenario analysis
* Involves creating different scenarios based on varying assumptions to understand potential outcomes and impacts of different decisions.
* Helps us prepare better for uncerainties.
