# WEEK I

## Introduction

### What you need to know about AI
AI -

* AI is not a modern development. It has been around as far back as the 90s

Different types of AI include
* Artifical Neural Networks
* Generative AI

* AI cant make decisions based on emotions
* AI can make stuff up, a process known as *AI Hallucinations*, thus the need for discretion when using information gotten from AI
* AI can sound racist and sexist, because they are as racist as the data they are trained on.
* AI has incredible potential


___Consider the potential benefits of AI, like improving healthcare or speeding up legal processes, against the risks of biases and inaccuracies.
How do you think society should handle the power of AI? What is one rule that you believe must be implemented to ensure AI is used safely and fairly? ___

I feel one rule that can be implemented to ensure that AI should be used properly and fairly would be a rule similar in principle to the Three Robot's law in Isaac Asimov books, having the AI  prioritize human well being first, then human instructions next, then its own well being.

### What is AI?
* The simulation of human intelligence in machines, programmed to think like humans and mimic its actions. or any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning, and problem solving.

### How doe AI work?
* They combine large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms to learn from patterns or features in data. It includes the major subfields.
* *Machine Learning*
    * allows computers to create models capable of analyzing data and making decisions or predictions
    * can automatically discover patterns and insights from data
* *Neural Networks*
    * Designed to work like the human brain
    * Consists of units that pass information to each other
    * Processes information in complex ways
* *Deep Learning*
    * Advanced form of neural networks
    * Involves many layers of these units and can handle vast amounts of data and extremely intricate patterns


## PROMPTING
This involves giving clear and concise instructions to the AI to get the most optimal output from it. There are six main principles or parts to a perfect prompt

* *Task:* Always start with a clear action verb and specify exactly what you're looking for
* *Context:* Provide neecessary background information that defines the scenario
  * for the context, consider the following background, success and environment
* *Exemplars:* Include examples to guide the AI's response style and content accuracy
* *Persona:* Define who the AI should emulate, eg a "senior developer" to align the tone and style of output
* *Format:* Envision the output structure eg list, essay, markdown
* *Tone:* Decide the emotional undertone or professional demeanor the result should follow.
